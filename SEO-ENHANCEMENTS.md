# SEO Enhancements for Global Debate Society

This document outlines the SEO enhancements implemented for the Global Debate Society website.

## 1. Structured Data Implementation

### JSON-LD Schemas

We've created structured data schemas using JSON-LD format for:

- **Organization** (`scripts/schemas/organization.json`): Organization information with contact details, social media profiles, and logo.
- **Event** (`scripts/schemas/event.json`): Events, competitions, and workshops with dates, location, and registration information.
- **Article** (`scripts/schemas/article.json`): Blog posts and news articles with author information, publication date, and content type.
- **WebPage** (`scripts/schemas/default.json`): Default schema for general pages with site information and content type.

These schemas help search engines understand the website content and enable rich results in search listings.

## 2. Meta Description Templates

Implemented automated meta description generation that:

- Extracts meaningful content from the first paragraph or main content
- Trims descriptions to optimal length (155-160 characters)
- Provides fallback descriptions when content extraction fails
- Preserves existing meta descriptions when already present

Meta descriptions improve click-through rates from search results by providing concise page summaries.

## 3. Open Graph Tags

Added Open Graph tags to all pages for better social media sharing:

- `og:title`: Page title for sharing
- `og:description`: Page description for sharing
- `og:url`: Canonical URL for the page
- `og:image`: Featured image for sharing
- `og:type`: Content type (website, article, event)
- `og:site_name`: "Global Debate Society"

Type-specific tags are also included:
- For articles: `article:published_time`, `article:author`
- For events: `event:start_time`

## 4. Twitter Card Support

Implemented Twitter Card support for enhanced Twitter sharing:

- `twitter:card`: Set to "summary_large_image" for large image previews
- `twitter:site`: "@globaldebate" account
- `twitter:title`: Page title
- `twitter:description`: Page description
- `twitter:image`: Featured image

## 5. Additional SEO Improvements

### Canonical URLs

- Added canonical URL tags to prevent duplicate content issues
- Generated based on file paths relative to site root

### Automatic Page Type Detection

- Implemented smart detection of page type based on content
- Applies appropriate schema based on detected content type
- Falls back to configured default when type can't be determined

### Integration with Build Process

- Added SEO enhancement to the build pipeline
- Update scripts can be run independently or as part of the build process

## Implementation Tools

The SEO enhancements are implemented through a Node.js script (`scripts/update-seo.js`) that:

1. Scans HTML files in specified directories
2. Detects page type based on content
3. Applies appropriate schema and meta tags
4. Generates missing meta descriptions
5. Adds Open Graph and Twitter Card tags
6. Updates canonical URLs

## Usage Instructions

The SEO enhancement tool can be run with:

```bash
npm run update-seo
```

Or with specific options:

```bash
node scripts/update-seo.js --dir=templates --output=dist/templates
```

For a test run without making changes:

```bash
node scripts/update-seo.js --dry-run
```

## Example

See `templates/responsive-image-example-with-seo.html` for a complete example of a page with all SEO enhancements applied.
