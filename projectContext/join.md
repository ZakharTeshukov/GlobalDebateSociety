# Join Page Architecture

## Overview
The Join page serves as the gateway for prospective members to sign up for the Global Debate Society. It guides users through the membership registration process and provides detailed information on membership benefits, requirements, and procedures.

## Layout & Components
- **Registration Form:** A comprehensive form capturing user details such as name, email, and membership type.
- **Membership Benefits:** A section outlining the advantages and incentives of joining the society.
- **Testimonials:** Excerpts from current members showcasing their experiences.
- **Call-to-Action:** Prominently placed button for submitting the registration.
- **Footer:** Consistent with the site-wide footer including contact and support information.

## Data & State Management
- Form data is processed and validated on both client and server sides.
- State management may be implemented with local state or a global store for managing form progress.

## Routing
- Accessible at the `/join` route, enabling easy registration access.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance form interactivity and validation feedback.
- Integrate with payment systems if membership fees are applicable.
- Implement multi-step forms with progress indicators for improved user experience.
